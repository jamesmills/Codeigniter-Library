h1. Personal Codeigniter libraries and helpers

This is a set of libraries and helpers that I use in all my projects so I thought it was about time to centralize it all and also share it...

* *text_formatting* - Make a MySQL DATETIME stamp look a little nicer!

h2. text_formatting

This will take a MySQL DATETIME stamp or whatever and will format it. 
* If the date+time is within the last few minuets it will return '<span class="nice_justnow">Just now! (2:30pm)</span>'
* If the date+time was today it will return '<span class="nice_today">Today</span>'
* If the date+time was yesterday it will return '<span class="nice_yesterday">Yesterday</span>'
* If the date+time is tomorrow it will return Tomorrow ' . date("g:ia", $my_date)

 (For today, yesterday and tomorrow - if there is a time it will also output the time)

<pre><code>
$this->load->library('text_formatting');
//$my_sql_datetime = '2010-10-04 22:25:15';
echo $this->text_formatting->date_special($my_sql_datetime);
</code></pre>
