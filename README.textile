h1. Personal Codeigniter libraries and helpers

This is a set of libraries and helpers that I use in all my projects so I thought it was about time to centralize it all and also share it...

* An easily customizable grid
* Sensible default typography
* A typographic baseline
* Perfected browser CSS reset
* A stylesheet for printing
* Powerful scripts for customization
* Absolutely no bloat!

h2. How to use

[code]
$this->load->library('text_formatting');
//$my_sql_datetime = '2010-10-04 22:25:15';
echo $this->text_formatting->date_special($my_sql_datetime);
[/code]
